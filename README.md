# CODEWARS-KATA

The website Codewars offers a variety of code challenges, known as kata, which are designed to enhance programming skills and techniques. These challenges can focus on building a foundation of programming fundamentals or solving more complex problems. Some katas require creative problem solving skills, while others are based on real-world coding scenarios.

In the Software Craftsmanship movement, programmers may refer to kata as small code snippets that they write in a single session, sometimes repeatedly, in order to improve their coding abilities through regular practice and muscle memory development.

It is important to note that these solutions are intended for educational purposes only  and should not be used directly on Codewars katas. Instead, it is recommended to create original solutions in order to maximize learning. These katas are the ways how I resolved it.
